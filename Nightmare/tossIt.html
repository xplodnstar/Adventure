    <h2>K-2 tosses the grenade at the encroaching Troopers, opening the alleyway for further progress. After making it to the archive storage library, the pursuing Troopers corner Cassian, Jyn, and K-2SO. While Jyn and Cassian search for the Stardust file that contains all the information her father left for her, K-2 needs to hold off the Troopers. Does he fight them off as they come, or lock the vault door, assuredly resulting in his death?</h2>
